## EXIT CONDITIONS

### Exit Happens When ANY of These Occur:

#### 1. **MDS Reversal / Neutral (Candle Close)**
```
Holding CE (Call) → MDS indicates reversal/neutral (score/slope/slow_mom) → EXIT
Holding PE (Put)  → MDS indicates reversal/neutral (score/slope/slow_mom) → EXIT
```
- Checked on every candle close
- Most common exit

#### 2. **Initial Stop Loss (On Every Tick)**
```
Entry Price - Initial SL points = SL Level
If Option LTP <= SL Level → EXIT
```
- Default: 50 points below entry
- Checked on EVERY TICK (responsive)
- Can be disabled (0 = off)

#### 3. **Max Loss Per Trade (On Every Tick)**
```
If Loss Amount >= Max Loss Limit → EXIT
Example: Max Loss = ₹500
```
- Only if enabled (default: 0 = disabled)
- Can be disabled

#### 4. **Target Hit (On Every Tick)**
```
If Profit >= Target Points → EXIT
Example: Target = 100 points
```
- Only if enabled (default: 0 = disabled)

#### 5. **Trailing Stop Loss (On Every Tick)**
```
1. Wait for trade to profit >= Trail Start Profit (e.g., 10 pts)
2. Set trailing SL at: (Current LTP - Trail Step)
3. If LTP drops below trailing SL → EXIT

Example:
- Entry: 100, Trail Start: 10, Trail Step: 5
- Profit reaches 15 pts → Trailing SL = 110
- If LTP drops to 109 → EXIT with 9 pts profit
```
- Only if both Trail Start > 0 AND Trail Step > 0
- Default: Trail Start = 0, Trail Step = 0 (DISABLED)

#### 6. **Force Square Off at 3:25 PM IST**
```
At 3:25 PM IST → Force exit ALL open positions
This ensures no overnight positions
```
